## About

Web Time Manager is a chrome extension that allows you to track the time you spend each day on your chrome browser.  It also allows you to set timers to limit the amount of time you spend on certain websites. 

## Purpose

I built Web Time Manager to be able to help me better track and manage the amount of time I spend online each day.  I wanted to keep the tracking and look of the extension simple.  While there are other extensions that perform a similar function, they were too busy for my liking.

I designed Web Time Manager with two main features: 

1. Daily and Weekly Chart
2. Timers to limit specific site usage(per day)

## Install

Feel free to download the extension and give it a try! [**Chrome** extension]()
